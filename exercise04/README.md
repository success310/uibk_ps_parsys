# Exercise 4

In this exercise, we will implement several algorithms which we will work on over the coming weeks.

## General Information

For each of the algorithms, follow these steps:
1. Create a set of unit tests for the algorithm.
2. Implement a sequential version of the algorithm.
3. Implement a parallel version of the algorithm using OpenMP.

Note that, for now, the implementation and parallelization do not have to be particularly optimal. We will continue to work on the efficiency of these programs.

## Algorithms

These algorithms should be implemented:
1. Calculating the number of solutions to the N-Queens problem. 
The input parameter for the program is the number N, and its output is the number of possible solutions.
2. Merge Sort.
The input for your program should be the size of the array to sort. The generated array should be filled randomly. 
The output is the result of a check that the array is actually sorted.
3. A Monte Carlo estimator for pi.
The input should be the number of samples to use in the estimation, the output is the approximation of pi which was computed.

Keep track of and document how long it takes you to implement the sequential version of each algorithm, and how long it takes you to parallelize it.

## General Note
*Every* member of your group should be ready to explain your methods and findings. All of you should also be able to answer in-depth question about the problem studied.
